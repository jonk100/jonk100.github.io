          <p>
              If a wise man said<br>
              That you'd be better off dead<br>
              Would you just believe him?<br><br>

              If a real cool fool<br>
              Told you to shoot up a school<br>
              Would you think to disagree?<br><br>

              Take a minute and think for yourself<br>
              Just sit and think<br>
              Think about what it means to you<br>
              And everybody else<br><br>

              Just think for yourself<br>
              But do it sometime close to now<br>
              Or twisted forces paying cash<br>
              Will do it for you, only they know how<br><br>

              If you wrote a politician<br>
              And he wrote back that he was fishin<br>
              Would that surprise you?<br>
              Did you think that he or she would listen?<br><br>

              If another person you thought was good<br>
              Were doing things you didn't think he should<br>
              Would you still be dissapointed? <br>
              Or would you wait to see what msnbc said?<br><br>

	      Just think yourself <br>
              Think about what it means for you<br>
              And everybody else<br><br>

              Think for yourself<br>
              but do it sometime close to now <br>
              or twisted forces paying cash<br>
              Will do it for you, like only they know how<br><br>

              Take a minute and think for yourself<br>
              Just sit and think<br>
              Think about what it means to you<br>
              And everybody else<br><br>

              Just think for yourself<br>
              But do it sometime close to now<br>
              Or twisted forces paying cash<br>
              Will do it for you, only they know how<br>
