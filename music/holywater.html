  <p>
    Why are you haunting me ghost?<br>
    I tried to give you a chance,<br>
    but you're not supposed to be here anymore,<br><br>

    If there's something you wanna say, just say it<br>
    But say it soon,<br>
    I'm telling you it's time to go now,<br>
    Not asking anymore,<br><br>

    Cuz I woke up with a plan today<br>
    I called my priest and he's on his way,<br>
    With a ten-gallon bucket of holy water,<br><br>

    So stop slamming my doors,<br>
    Quit creaking my floors,<br>
    I know this was your house before,<br>
    But I bought it fair and square,<br>
    So it's time to go,<br><br>

    Oh, and one little piece of advice, though,<br>
    Since you value your life so<br>
    Much, it seems,<br>
    Stay the hell out of my wife's dreams,<br><br>

    She hasn't been sleeping much,<br>
    I checked all her searches and such,<br>
    And she's been looking up what kinds of arrows,<br>
    Are most effective against the dead,<br><br>

    I know you're probly laughin' 'cuz an arrow or two,<br>
    Wouldn't scare you,<br>
    But I'm here to tell you it should,<br><br>

    I've seen that woman pull a bow from her purse,<br>
    While we were playin' cards,<br>
    And shoot a turkey dead,<br>
    From two-hundred fifty yards,<br><br>

    I woke up with a plan today<br>
    I called my priest, he's on his way,<br>
    With a ten-gallon bucket of holy water,<br><br>

    So stop slamming my doors,<br>
    Quit creaking my floors,<br>
    I know this was your house before,<br>
    But I bought it fair and square,<br>
    So it's time to go,<br><br>


    It's not ideal for you I know,<br>
    But there's far worse ways to go,<br>
    My wife would stuff you,<br>
    And hang you on the wall by the window,<br><br>

    Hey ghost, let me grab my pen,<br>
    I know you've been messin' with my plants again',<br>
    And maaaaaan I'm so tired of documenting all of your nonsense,<br><br>

    So I woke up with a plan today,<br>
    I called my priest and he's on his way,<br>
    With a ten-gallon bucket of holy water,<br><br>

    I don't even care where you hid my keys,<br>
    Or my other sock,<br>
    Or if it's twenty degrees from zero,<br>
    Or if gas is the highest it's been since the year '04,<br><br>

    Don't close any doors,<br>
    Don't give any tours,<br>
    We get it, this was your house before,<br>
    But it's not anymore,<br>
    And it's time for you to go,<br><br>

    (miscellaneous harmonies)<br>
    Go home, ghost!<br><br>
  </p><br><br>
