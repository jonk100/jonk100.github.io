      (... now?)<br>

      Show me your feathers,<br>
      Show me your teeth,<br>
      Let me see what you've got hiding underneath,<br>
      Your fancy suit,<br><br>

      I took one look at you,<br>
      Saw the way you moved,<br>
      And I think I knew,<br>
      You might be something Id be into,<br><br>

      Animal inside,<br>
      Wagging tails,<br>
      Eight, nine, or five?<br>
      Or are they stuck between your legs?<br><br>

      No need to hide,<br>
      You can talk to me,<br>
      I'm not your enemy,<br>
      I've got an animal inside too,<br><br>

      You could be a reptile, <br>
      A mammal, a bird or a fish,<br>
      The greatest guy,<br>
      Or the biggest bitch,<br><br>

      You could be a cephalopod,<br>
      Or an invertebrate,<br>
      The nicest lady,<br>
      Or an ingrate,<br><br>

      Animal inside,<br>
      Wagging tails,<br>
      Eight, nine, or five?<br>
      Or are they stuck between your legs?<br><br>

      No need to hide,<br>
      You can talk to me,<br>
      I'm not your enemy,<br>
      I've got an animal inside, too,<br><br>

      You could be so well-intentioned,<br>
      That it hurt you,<br>
      Or a careless, typical human,<br>
      I'd desert you,<br><br>

      Maybe a powerful,<br>
      Force for good,<br>
      Or an evil and dangerous cancer,<br>
      Don't know if I should,<br>
      Talk to you at all,<br>
      Or why I'm even writing this song,<br>
      But if you're feeling it,<br>
      Fuck it... just come along<br><br>

      Animal inside,<br>
      Wagging tails,<br>
      Eight, nine, or five?<br>
      Or are they stuck between your legs?<br><br>

      No need to hide,<br>
      You can talk to me,<br>
      I'm not your enemy,<br>
      I've got an animal inside too<br><br>
