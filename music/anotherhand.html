    <p> <!-- lyrics -->
      I need another hand, he said,<br>
      I've been short on luck since 1995,<br>
      That's the last time I gave a fuck,<br>
      And the last time I felt alive,<br><br>

      And I don't know how you sleep at night,<br>
      Some things are black and white,<br>
      But be a bit more polite, now,<br>
      You'll notice you'll start making friends,<br><br>

      I need another leg, up on you,<br>
      What would you have me do?<br>
      I never saw you as an easily persuaded lady,<br><br>

      Back when you were alive we really got along,<br>
      Now we're writing songs,<br>
      And I see that,<br>
      You couldn't be that,<br>
      Crazy for me, is that right or wrong?<br><br>

      (Is it wrong to stay so long? Just say so long),<br>
      (Say so long, say so long),<br>
      (We really got along, and now we're writing songs),<br><br>

      I bet that you feel special, pretty girl,<br>
      I do too, we're at the center of our own worlds,<br>
      It's true,<br>
      But I could use a break right now,<br><br>

      I bet that you feel pretty, special guy,<br>
      I do too, but when I take a look in the mirror it's empty,<br>
      And I'm not sure why,<br><br>

      Now we're writing songs!<br>
