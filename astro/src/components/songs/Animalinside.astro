  (... now?)<br>

  Show me your feathers,<br>
  Show me your teeth,<br>
  Let me see what you've got hiding underneath,<br>
  Your fancy suit,<br><br>

  I took one look at you,<br>
  Saw the way you moved,<br>
  And I think I knew,<br>
  You might be something Id be into,<br><br>

  Animal inside,<br>
  Wagging tails,<br>
  Eight, nine, or five?<br>
  Or are they stuck between your legs?<br><br>

  No need to hide,<br>
  You can talk to me,<br>
  I'm not your enemy,<br>
  I've got an animal inside too,<br><br>

  You could be a reptile, <br>
  A mammal, a bird or a fish,<br>
  The greatest guy,<br>
  Or the biggest bitch,<br><br>

  You could be a cephalopod,<br>
  Or an invertebrate,<br>
  The nicest lady,<br>
  Or an ingrate,<br><br>

  Animal inside,<br>
  Wagging tails,<br>
  Eight, nine, or five?<br>
  Or are they stuck between your legs?<br><br>

  No need to hide,<br>
  You can talk to me,<br>
  I'm not your enemy,<br>
  I've got an animal inside, too,<br><br>

  You could be so well-intentioned,<br>
  That it hurt you,<br>
  Or a careless, typical human,<br>
  I'd desert you,<br><br>

  Maybe a powerful,<br>
  Force for good,<br>
  Or an evil and dangerous cancer,<br>
  Don't know if I should,<br>
  Talk to you at all,<br>
  Or why I'm even writing this song,<br>
  But if you're feeling it,<br>
  Fuck it... just come along<br><br>

  Animal inside,<br>
  Wagging tails,<br>
  Eight, nine, or five?<br>
  Or are they stuck between your legs?<br><br>

  No need to hide,<br>
  You can talk to me,<br>
  I'm not your enemy,<br>
  I've got an animal inside too<br><br>
