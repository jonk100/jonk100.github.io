<p>
  Why are you haunting me ghost?<br>
  I tried to give you a chance,<br>
  but you're not supposed to be here anymore,<br><br>
  
  If there's something you wanna say, just say it<br>
  But say it soon,<br>
  I'm telling you it's time to go now,<br>
  Not asking anymore,<br><br>

  Cuz I woke up with a plan today<br>
  I called my priest and he's on his way,<br>
  With a ten-gallon bucket of holy water,<br><br>

  So stop slamming my doors,<br>
  Quit creaking my floors,<br>
  I know this was your house before,<br>
  But I bought it fair and square,<br>
  So it's time to go,<br><br>

  Oh, and one little piece of advice, though,<br>
  Since you value your life so<br>
  Much, it seems,<br>
  Stay the hell out of my wife's dreams,<br><br>

  She hasn't been sleeping much,<br>
  I checked all her searches and such,<br>
  And she's been looking up what kinds of arrows,<br>
  Are most effective against the dead,<br><br>

  I know you're probly laughin' 'cuz an arrow or two,<br>
  Wouldn't scare you,<br>
  But I'm here to tell you it should,<br><br>

  I've seen that woman pull a bow from her purse,<br>
  While we were playin' cards,<br>
  And shoot a turkey dead,<br>
  From two-hundred fifty yards,<br><br>

  I woke up with a plan today<br>
  I called my priest, he's on his way,<br>
  With a ten-gallon bucket of holy water,<br><br>

  So stop slamming my doors,<br>
  Quit creaking my floors,<br>
  I know this was your house before,<br>
  But I bought it fair and square,<br>
  So it's time to go,<br><br>


  It's not ideal for you I know,<br>
  But there's far worse ways to go,<br>
  My wife would stuff you,<br>
  And hang you on the wall by the window,<br><br>

  Hey ghost, let me grab my pen,<br>
  I know you've been messin' with my plants again',<br>
  And maaaaaan I'm so tired of documenting all of your nonsense,<br><br>

  So I woke up with a plan today,<br>
  I called my priest and he's on his way,<br>
  With a ten-gallon bucket of holy water,<br><br>

  I don't even care where you hid my keys,<br>
  Or my other sock,<br>
  Or if it's twenty degrees from zero,<br>
  Or if gas is the highest it's been since the year '04,<br><br>
  
  Don't close any doors,<br>
  Don't give any tours,<br>
  We get it, this was your house before,<br>
  But it's not anymore,<br>
  And it's time for you to go,<br><br>

  (miscellaneous harmonies)<br>
  Go home, ghost!<br><br>
