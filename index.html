      <h3>Wanna Be</h3>
        <p>
          I know you, youre sitting there<br>
          In your favorite chair<br>
          Eyes on some guys on TV<br>
          Thinking about me<br><br>
          
          Why do you even care<br>
          If i go to sleep?<br>
          I'll be there tomorrow anyway<br>
          No hours to keep<br><br>
          
          If you put as much time<br>
          Into yours as you did mine<br>
          You could be<br>
          Don't you want to be?<br><br>
          
          I know its not my place to say<br>
          I'm so sick of the games, i don't play<br>
          I just want to be<br>
          Ya, I wanna be<br><br>
          
          I try to write a song<br>
          All I see is you<br>
          It's a silly place to go<br>
          But at least I know<br><br>

          So please just do it as you please<br>
          You're always on your knees,<br>
          Ok, i like it that way<br>
          You know i do, but please today<br>
          I hope you<br><br>
          
          Put as much time<br>
          Into yours as you have mine<br>

      <h3>Animal Inside</h3>
      <p>
        (... now?)<br>

        Show me your feathers,<br>
        Show me your teeth,<br>
        Let me see what you've got hiding underneath,<br>
        Your fancy suit,<br><br>

        I took one look at you,<br>
        Saw the way you moved,<br>
        And I think I knew,<br>
        You might be something Id be into,<br><br>

        Animal inside,<br>
        Wagging tails,<br>
        Eight, nine, or five?<br>
        Or are they stuck between your legs?<br><br>

        No need to hide,<br>
        You can talk to me,<br>
        I'm not your enemy,<br>
        I've got an animal inside too,<br><br>

        You could be a reptile, <br>
        A mammal, a bird or a fish,<br>
        The greatest guy,<br>
        Or the biggest bitch,<br><br>

        You could be a cephalopod,<br>
        Or an invertebrate,<br>
        The nicest lady,<br>
        Or an ingrate,<br><br>

        Animal inside,<br>
        Wagging tails,<br>
        Eight, nine, or five?<br>
        Or are they stuck between your legs?<br><br>

        No need to hide,<br>
        You can talk to me,<br>
        I'm not your enemy,<br>
        I've got an animal inside, too,<br><br>

        You could be so well-intentioned,<br>
        That it hurt you,<br>
        Or a careless, typical human,<br>
        I'd desert you,<br><br>

        Maybe a powerful,<br>
        Force for good,<br>
        Or an evil and dangerous cancer,<br>
        Don't know if I should,<br>
        Talk to you at all,<br>
        Or why I'm even writing this song,<br>
        But if you're feeling it,<br>
        Fuck it... just come along<br><br>

        Animal inside,<br>
        Wagging tails,<br>
        Eight, nine, or five?<br>
        Or are they stuck between your legs?<br><br>

        No need to hide,<br>

      <h3>Holy Water</h3>
      <p>
        Why are you haunting me ghost?<br>
        I tried to give you a chance,<br>
        but you're not supposed to be here anymore,<br><br>
        
        If there's something you wanna say, just say it<br>
        But say it soon,<br>
        I'm telling you it's time to go now,<br>
        Not asking anymore,<br><br>

        Cuz I woke up with a plan today<br>
        I called my priest and he's on his way,<br>
        With a ten-gallon bucket of holy water,<br><br>

        So stop slamming my doors,<br>
        Quit creaking my floors,<br>
        I know this was your house before,<br>
        But I bought it fair and square,<br>
        So it's time to go,<br><br>

        Oh, and one little piece of advice, though,<br>
        Since you value your life so<br>
        Much, it seems,<br>
        Stay the hell out of my wife's dreams,<br><br>

        She hasn't been sleeping much,<br>
        I checked all her searches and such,<br>
        And she's been looking up what kinds of arrows,<br>
        Are most effective against the dead,<br><br>

        I know you're probly laughin' 'cuz an arrow or two,<br>
        Wouldn't scare you,<br>
        But I'm here to tell you it should,<br><br>

        I've seen that woman pull a bow from her purse,<br>
        While we were playin' cards,<br>
        And shoot a turkey dead,<br>
        From two-hundred fifty yards,<br><br>

        I woke up with a plan today<br>
        I called my priest, he's on his way,<br>
        With a ten-gallon bucket of holy water,<br><br>

        So stop slamming my doors,<br>
        Quit creaking my floors,<br>
        I know this was your house before,<br>
        But I bought it fair and square,<br>
        So it's time to go,<br><br>


        It's not ideal for you I know,<br>
        But there's far worse ways to go,<br>
        My wife would stuff you,<br>
        And hang you on the wall by the window,<br><br>

        Hey ghost, let me grab my pen,<br>
        I know you've been messin' with my plants again',<br>
        And maaaaaan I'm so tired of documenting all of your nonsense,<br><br>

        So I woke up with a plan today,<br>
        I called my priest and he's on his way,<br>
        With a ten-gallon bucket of holy water,<br><br>

        I don't even care where you hid my keys,<br>
        Or my other sock,<br>
        Or if it's twenty degrees from zero,<br>
        Or if gas is the highest it's been since the year '04,<br><br>
        
        Don't close any doors,<br>
        Don't give any tours,<br>
        We get it, this was your house before,<br>
        But it's not anymore,<br>
        And it's time for you to go,<br><br>

        (miscellaneous harmonies)<br>
        Go home, ghost!<br><br>

      <h3>Think for Yourself</h3>
      <p>
        If a wise man said<br>
        That you'd be better off dead<br>
        Would you just believe him?<br><br>
      
        If a real cool fool<br>
        Told you to shoot up a school<br>
        Would you think to disagree?<br><br>
        
        Take a minute and think for yourself<br>
        Just sit and think<br>
        Think about what it means to you<br>
        And everybody else<br><br>
        
        Just think for yourself<br>
        But do it sometime close to now<br>
        Or twisted forces paying cash<br>
        Will do it for you, only they know how<br><br>
        
        If you wrote a politician<br>
        And he wrote back that he was fishin<br>
        Would that surprise you?<br>
        Did you think that he or she would listen?<br><br>
        
        If another person you thought was good<br>
        Were doing things you didn't think he should<br>
        Would you still be dissapointed? <br>
        Or would you wait to see what msnbc said?<br><br>
        
        Just think yourself <br>
        Think about what it means for you<br>
        And everybody else<br><br>
        
        Think for yourself<br>
        but do it sometime close to now <br>
        or twisted forces paying cash<br>
        Will do it for you, like only they know how<br><br>
        
        Take a minute and think for yourself<br>
        Just sit and think<br>
        Think about what it means to you<br>

      <h3>Crashed Mummy</h3>
      <p>
        Flying through time and space,<br>
        Finally free to be immortal,<br>
        He was the king of men,<br>
        But he's been on a bad streak of luck since then,<br><br>

        I'll try to remember,<br>
        That story I heard,<br>
        I just hope I can sing it,<br>
        I wanna spread the word,<br><br>

        I guess they say it's best to start at the start,<br>
        Could be true,<br> 
        I don't know that part,<br>
        Or I do, <br> 
        And it doesn't rhyme,<br>
        Maybe I'll make it next time,<br><br>

        For now i'll let you know what I know,<br>
        And when it's my time to go I'll go,<br>
        I got what I got,<br>
        You'll hear what you're here for,<br><br>

        Ramses II.. ..or IV ...or III,<br>
        Was murdered while he slept,<br>
        But luckily they kept him,<br>
        And made him a mummy,<br><br>

        So he got to go,<br>
        To wherever-it-is although,<br>
        He did not prepare,<br>
        He had to ask for directions somewhere<br>
        along the way,<br><br>

        And the guy he asked,<br>
        Had a fantastic<br>
        sense of humor,<br>
        He sent him to LA,<br>
        And that would've been ok,<br><br>

        But my man was tired, and he missed his wife,<br>
        He just wanted to get to the afterlife,<br>
        So he gave it up,<br>
        And crashed into the sea,<br><br>

        I got no clue,<br>
        How or why,<br>
        They kept him alive,<br>
        I guess something to do,<br>
        With his mummified remains,<br>
        He could deal with the aches and the pains,<br><br>

        But he didn't expect<br>
        to wake up and be in,<br>
        For such a rude awakenin',<br>
        It seemed the whole city had it out for him,<br><br>

        You see, history had not been kind,<br>
        To Ancient Egypt, he would find,<br>
        And probably rightfully so,<br>
        They enslaved a ton of people, you know,<br><br>

        But those silly tombs were not on him,<br>
        He said he'd advocated against them,<br>
        Too many times to try to tell it all today,<br>
        And anyway,<br><br>

        The people his father forced,<br>
        To build those fucking pyramids, of course<br>
        They ran the city now,<br>
        And they meant to make him bow,<br><br>

        He couldn't leave, he had to stay,<br>
        So he learned to put his ego away,<br>
        And just sit and listen,<br><br>

        Aaaaaaaaand he learned a lot,<br>
        But maaaaaaaaaan they really got to him,<br>
        Maaaaaaaaaaan he really thought,<br>
        They would keep him there for eternity,<br><br>

        He wondered how long would it take,<br>
        To bust a wall so full of hate,<br>
        But as he wondered a plan snuck into his mind,<br><br>

        Shortly after that he was on an airplane,<br>
        Flying over the Nile, <br>
        The view was insane, <br>
        He hadn't seen his home in a while,<br><br>

        And the job hed agreed to do,<br>
        Had gotten easier since whenever-thousand-2,<br>
        They just wanted him there for the optics,<br><br>

        As he watched those wonders fall,<br>
        He wished he could give his dad a call,<br>
        The afterlife, it just suddenly seemed so small,<br>
        And far away and pointless,<br><br>

        He'd been blessed,<br>
        With another life he guessed,<br>
        A chance to redeem the people of egypt,<br>
        For treating other people like objects,<br><br>

        So he put on a shirt and tie,<br>
        Even though he didn't really get the why,<br>
        He just knew if he kept wearing TP,<br>
        He might as well not even try<br>
        to make any friends,<br><br>

        He'd been friendless for far too long,<br>
        He'd got to so right from so so wrong,<br>
        And there's more to the story,<br>
        But I'll save it for the next song,<br><br>

      <h3>Another Hand</h3>
      <p>
        I need another hand, he said,<br>
        I've been short on luck since 1995,<br>
        That's the last time I gave a fuck,<br>
        And the last time I felt alive,<br><br>

        And I don't know how you sleep at night,<br>
        Some things are black and white,<br>
        But be a bit more polite, now,<br>
        You'll notice you'll start making friends,<br><br>

        I need another leg, up on you,<br>
        What would you have me do?<br>
        I never saw you as an easily persuaded lady,<br><br>

        Back when you were alive we really got along,<br>
        Now we're writing songs,<br>
        And I see that,<br>
        You couldn't be that,<br>
        Crazy for me, is that right or wrong?<br><br>

        (Is it wrong to stay so long? Just say so long),<br>
        (Say so long, say so long),<br>
        (We really got along, and now we're writing songs),<br><br>

        I bet that you feel special, pretty girl,<br>
        I do too, we're at the center of our own worlds,<br>
        It's true,<br>
        But I could use a break right now,<br><br>

        I bet that you feel pretty, special guy,<br>
        I do too, but when I take a look in the mirror it's empty,<br>
        And I'm not sure why,<br><br>

        Now we're writing songs!<br>

      <h3>Old Country Man</h3>
      <p>
        I came across a man,<br> 
        from the old country some time ago,<br>
        He had a ribbon in his hat, <br>
        and I loved him for that,<br>
        Yeah, you know,<br><br>

        Woa is him,<br> 
        he looked grim,<br> 
        he looked tough,<br>
        Woa is he, I'd already had enough,<br>
        But he called, so I waited for him,<br><br>

        He said, "Hello, my friend,<br> 
        have you seen a blue locket?"<br>
        Said, "no."<br>
        He held up one finger as he reached in his pocket, "Here you go"<br><br>

        Woa is me, <br>
        I decree, <br>
        what a terrible joke,<br>
        Woa is he, <br>
        Cuz I was drunk, and on coke, <br>
        So I shot him,<br><br>

        When I saw him again,<br> I admit that I was a bit shaken,<br>
        He looked pale, not dead,<br> but with a hole in his head,<br> and he'd awakened,<br>

        Woa is me,<br> not a man but a ghost,<br>
        It was he, <br>even though he was supposed to be dead,<br><br>

        I laced up my boots,<br> readied my mind for a fight,<br>
        I went for my weapon, but then I didn't need one that night,<br><br>

        Woa now, I wonder,<br> 
        how the hell he forgot,<br>
        Woa and then, <br>
        he asked me to borrow my pen,<br> 
        I think not.. <br><br>
