          I know you, youre sitting there<br>
          In your favorite chair<br>
          Eyes on some guys on TV<br>
          Thinking about me<br><br>
          
          Why do you even care<br>
          If i go to sleep?<br>
          I'll be there tomorrow anyway<br>
          No hours to keep<br><br>
          
          If you put as much time<br>
          Into yours as you did mine<br>

          Ya, I wanna be<br><br>
          
          I try to write a song<br>

          Your fancy suit,<br><br>

          I took one look at you,<br>
          Saw the way you moved,<br>

          You might be something Id be into,<br><br>

          You could be a reptile, <br>
          A mammal, a bird or a fish,<br>
          The greatest guy,<br>
          Or the biggest bitch,<br><br>

          You could be so well-intentioned,<br>
          That it hurt you,<br>
          Or a careless, typical human,<br>
          I'd desert you,<br><br>

          Maybe a powerful,<br>
          Force for good,<br>
          Or an evil and dangerous cancer,<br>
          Don't know if I should,<br>
          Talk to you at all,<br>

        <p>
          Why are you haunting me ghost?<br>
          I tried to give you a chance,<br>
          but you're not supposed to be here anymore,<br><br>
          
          If there's something you wanna say, just say it<br>
          But say it soon,<br>
          I'm telling you it's time to go now,<br>
          Not asking anymore,<br><br>

          Cuz I woke up with a plan today<br>
          I called my priest and he's on his way,<br>
          With a ten-gallon bucket of holy water,<br><br>

          So stop slamming my doors,<br>
          Quit creaking my floors,<br>
          I know this was your house before,<br>
          But I bought it fair and square,<br>
          So it's time to go,<br><br>

          Oh, and one little piece of advice, though,<br>
          Since you value your life so<br>
          Much, it seems,<br>
          Stay the hell out of my wife's dreams,<br><br>

          She hasn't been sleeping much,<br>
          I checked all her searches and such,<br>
          And she's been looking up what kinds of arrows,<br>
          Are most effective against the dead,<br><br>

          I know you're probly laughin' 'cuz an arrow or two,<br>
          Wouldn't scare you,<br>
          But I'm here to tell you it should,<br><br>

          I've seen that woman pull a bow from her purse,<br>
          While we were playin' cards,<br>
          And shoot a turkey dead,<br>
          From two-hundred fifty yards,<br><br>

          I woke up with a plan today<br>
          I called my priest, he's on his way,<br>
          With a ten-gallon bucket of holy water,<br><br>

          So stop slamming my doors,<br>
          Quit creaking my floors,<br>
          I know this was your house before,<br>
          But I bought it fair and square,<br>
          So it's time to go,<br><br>


          It's not ideal for you I know,<br>
          But there's far worse ways to go,<br>
          My wife would stuff you,<br>
          And hang you on the wall by the window,<br><br>

          Hey ghost, let me grab my pen,<br>
          I know you've been messin' with my plants again',<br>
          And maaaaaan I'm so tired of documenting all of your nonsense,<br><br>

          So I woke up with a plan today,<br>
          I called my priest and he's on his way,<br>
          With a ten-gallon bucket of holy water,<br><br>

          I don't even care where you hid my keys,<br>
          Or my other sock,<br>
          Or if it's twenty degrees from zero,<br>
          Or if gas is the highest it's been since the year '04,<br><br>
          
          Don't close any doors,<br>
          Don't give any tours,<br>
          We get it, this was your house before,<br>
          But it's not anymore,<br>
          And it's time for you to go,<br><br>

          (miscellaneous harmonies)<br>
          Go home, ghost!<br><br>

        <p>
          Flying through time and space,<br>
          Finally free to be immortal,<br>
          He was the king of men,<br>
          But he's been on a bad streak of luck since then,<br><br>

          I'll try to remember,<br>
          That story I heard,<br>
          I just hope I can sing it,<br>
          I wanna spread the word,<br><br>

          I guess they say it's best to start at the start,<br>
          Could be true,<br> 
          I don't know that part,<br>
          Or I do, <br> 
          And it doesn't rhyme,<br>
          Maybe I'll make it next time,<br><br>

          For now i'll let you know what I know,<br>
          And when it's my time to go I'll go,<br>
          I got what I got,<br>
          You'll hear what you're here for,<br><br>

          Ramses II.. ..or IV ...or III,<br>
          Was murdered while he slept,<br>
          But luckily they kept him,<br>
          And made him a mummy,<br><br>

          So he got to go,<br>
          To wherever-it-is although,<br>
          He did not prepare,<br>
          He had to ask for directions somewhere<br>
          along the way,<br><br>

          And the guy he asked,<br>
          Had a fantastic<br>
          sense of humor,<br>
          He sent him to LA,<br>
          And that would've been ok,<br><br>

          But my man was tired, and he missed his wife,<br>
          He just wanted to get to the afterlife,<br>
          So he gave it up,<br>
          And crashed into the sea,<br><br>

          I got no clue,<br>
          How or why,<br>
          They kept him alive,<br>
          I guess something to do,<br>
          With his mummified remains,<br>
          He could deal with the aches and the pains,<br><br>

          But he didn't expect<br>
          to wake up and be in,<br>
          For such a rude awakenin',<br>
          It seemed the whole city had it out for him,<br><br>

          You see, history had not been kind,<br>
          To Ancient Egypt, he would find,<br>
          And probably rightfully so,<br>
          They enslaved a ton of people, you know,<br><br>

          But those silly tombs were not on him,<br>
          He said he'd advocated against them,<br>
          Too many times to try to tell it all today,<br>
          And anyway,<br><br>

          The people his father forced,<br>
          To build those fucking pyramids, of course<br>
          They ran the city now,<br>
          And they meant to make him bow,<br><br>

          He couldn't leave, he had to stay,<br>
          So he learned to put his ego away,<br>
          And just sit and listen,<br><br>

          Aaaaaaaaand he learned a lot,<br>
          But maaaaaaaaaan they really got to him,<br>
          Maaaaaaaaaaan he really thought,<br>
          They would keep him there for eternity,<br><br>

          He wondered how long would it take,<br>
          To bust a wall so full of hate,<br>
          But as he wondered a plan snuck into his mind,<br><br>

          Shortly after that he was on an airplane,<br>
          Flying over the Nile, <br>
          The view was insane, <br>
          He hadn't seen his home in a while,<br><br>

          And the job hed agreed to do,<br>
          Had gotten easier since whenever-thousand-2,<br>
          They just wanted him there for the optics,<br><br>

          As he watched those wonders fall,<br>
          He wished he could give his dad a call,<br>
          The afterlife, it just suddenly seemed so small,<br>
          And far away and pointless,<br><br>

          He'd been blessed,<br>
          With another life he guessed,<br>
          A chance to redeem the people of egypt,<br>
          For treating other people like objects,<br><br>

          So he put on a shirt and tie,<br>
          Even though he didn't really get the why,<br>
          He just knew if he kept wearing TP,<br>
          He might as well not even try<br>
          to make any friends,<br><br>

          He'd been friendless for far too long,<br>
          He'd got to so right from so so wrong,<br>
          And there's more to the story,<br>
          But I'll save it for the next song,<br><br>

          That's the last time I gave a fuck,<br>
          And the last time I felt alive,<br><br>

          And I don't know how you sleep at night,<br>
          Some things are black and white,<br>
          But be a bit more polite, now,<br>
          You'll notice you'll start making friends,<br><br>

          I need another leg, up on you,<br>
          What would you have me do?<br>
          I never saw you as an easily persuaded lady,<br><br>

          Back when you were alive we really got along,<br>
          Now we're writing songs,<br>
          And I see that,<br>
          You couldn't be that,<br>
          Crazy for me, is that right or wrong?<br><br>

          (Is it wrong to stay so long? Just say so long),<br>
          (Say so long, say so long),<br>
          (We really got along, and now we're writing songs),<br><br>

          I bet that you feel special, pretty girl,<br>
          I do too, we're at the center of our own worlds,<br>
          It's true,<br>
          But I could use a break right now,<br><br>

          I bet that you feel pretty, special guy,<br>
          I do too, but when I take a look in the mirror it's empty,<br>
          And I'm not sure why,<br><br>

          Now we're writing songs!<br>
